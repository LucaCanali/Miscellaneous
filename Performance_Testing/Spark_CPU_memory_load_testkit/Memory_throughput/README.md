# Memory throughput
This folder contains measurements of memory throughput taken while running a memory-intensive workload with test_Spark_CPU_memory_sparkmeasure.py
Measurements were taken on AMD systems using:  
`/opt/AMDuProf_4.0-341/bin/AMDuProfPcm -m memory -a -d 20 -C -A system`

Note for Intel CPUs the equivalent tool would be pcm-memory, see also
[Tools_Linux_Memory_Perf_Measure.md](../../../Spark_Notes/Tools_Linux_Memory_Perf_Measure.md)
