# Notes on TPCDS queries

The TPC-DS benchmark is composed of 99 queries that are designed to simulate real-world business intelligence.
The queries are complex and are designed to test the performance of a system under complex SQL workloads.

Analyzing the queries, their execution plan, and performance profile can be a good exercise on complex SQL and learning
Spark and data processing in general.

## Example Query

TPC-DS Q1:
```
WITH customer_total_return AS
( SELECT
    sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
    sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk,
    sum(sr_return_amt) AS ctr_total_return
  FROM store_returns, date_dim
  WHERE sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2000
  GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk)
SELECT c_customer_id
FROM customer_total_return ctr1, store, customer
WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return >
  (SELECT avg(ctr_total_return) * 1.2
  FROM customer_total_return ctr2
  WHERE ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk)
  AND s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
  AND s_state = 'TN'
  AND ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
ORDER BY c_customer_id
LIMIT 100
```

The Query description was obtained automatically using a LLM by feeding the query text and the schema description:
"""
Query Q1 of the TPC-DS benchmark is designed to analyze customer returns in a retail context.
The query operates over a simulated retail database schema, focusing on identifying customers
whose total return amounts are significantly higher (in this context, more than 20% higher)
than the average return amount for the store in which the returns were made, during the year 2000.
It specifically targets returns in stores located in the state of Tennessee (TN).
"""

TPC-DS Q3:
```
SELECT
  dt.d_year,
  item.i_brand_id brand_id,
  item.i_brand brand,
  SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) sum_agg
FROM date_dim dt, store_sales, item
WHERE dt.d_date_sk = store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk
  AND store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
  AND item.i_manufact_id = 128
  AND dt.d_moy = 11
GROUP BY dt.d_year, item.i_brand, item.i_brand_id
ORDER BY dt.d_year, sum_agg DESC, brand_id
LIMIT 100
```

The Query description was obtained automatically using a LLM:
"""
Query Q3 of the TPC-DS benchmark focuses on analyzing sales performance for products from a
specific manufacturer (identified by i_manufact_id = 128) during the month of November across
different years. The aim is to aggregate sales data to understand yearly trends for this
manufacturer's brands, highlighting which brands perform best in terms of sales within the
specified month.
